To check on the status of an order, grab your order number and email address and use the Track Order function (Where’s My Order?) on our website. Your info’s all there! We will also send automated updates via email when your order ships, so keep an eye out.</p><p>For international orders, tracking ends once the package arrives at the customs agency for the destination country and then at the local postal service for final delivery. At the point the package is handed off to the customs agency, we consider the package delivered.</p><p>If you have ordered several items, they are often shipped out in separate packages so that you may receive them on different days. You will receive an email with a tracking number for each package sent. For estimated delivery dates, see the information in your online receipt.</p>",

    "What is the Billing Postal Code and why do I need it?": "<p>A postal code (also known locally in various countries as a postcode, postcode, PIN, or ZIP Code) is a series of letters or digits or both, sometimes including spaces or punctuation, included in a postal address sort mail.</p><p>The Billing Postal Code required in the “PAYMENT INFO” section should match the postal or zip code on the address registered to your credit card.</p>",
